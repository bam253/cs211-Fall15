# Rutgers CS211 Computer Architecture Fall 2015
All assignments (except the extra credit assignment 5) are included, and all received all possible credit and extra credit (i.e. why I didn't do assignment 5). This has been my least favorite class and I can't be happier that I never have to do this again.
